# Material for R/Bioconductor meetup in Boston, Feb 5th 2020

There are three scripts which show the commands I use in the demonstration for using Bioconductor with Docker. 

The slides are present at the link https://bit.ly/bioc-docker-2020

If you have questions please file issues https://github.com/nturaga/r-bioconductor-meetup/issues. I'll answer them.
